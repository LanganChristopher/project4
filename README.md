## Problem Statement

How can we measure the economic impact of a disaster in terms of wages and unemployment?

## Plan

In order to approach this problem, we will look at an isolated natural disaster and investigate the economic impact that may have resulted in localities that were affected by the disaster. In this project, we will use Hurricane Sandy as a case study.

We will first select some relevant localities for analysis. Since we are investigating Hurricane Sandy, we will select Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coastal cities in the United States. This part of the United States was the most directly in the path of the storm.

The following localities will be analyzed:

- Atlantic City, NJ
- Baltimore, MD
- Boston, MA
- Bridgeport, CT
- New Haven, CT
- New London, CT
- Newport, RI
- Ocean City, MD
- Portland, ME
- Providence, RI

We will analyze the wages and unemployment in these localitites. The wage data is broken down by industry, and we will investigate how wages in each of these industries may have been impacted by Sandy.

In order to compare the relative impact of the storm in each of the localities of analysis, we will also investigate weather data that is related to the intensity of the storm conditions. We will be interested to see to what extent the relative economic impact in each locality is reflected by the relative intensity of the storm in each locality.

## Hypotheses

The following hypotheses will frame the focus of our analysis:

1. The occurrence of a natural disaster will lead to a pronounced loss of wages and increase in unemployment.

In general, we think that the occurrence of a distaster will have an economic impact on localities in the path of the disaster. The economic metrics that we are analyzing are wages and unemployment, so we think that we will see a drop in wages and an uptick in unemployment in the localities of analysis at the time immediately following Hurricane Sandy.

2. The occurrence of a natural disaster will negatively affect wages in tourism industries.

We think that tourism industries will experience the largest impact from a disaster, because those industries are based on people visiting, and people spending money in these localities. During a disaster event like a hurricane, we would expect that, for a somewhat extended period of time surrounding the disaster, there would be a a major dip in any tourism-related spending, and that this may ultimately be reflected in wages.

3. The occurrence of a natural disaster will not significantly affect wages in professional industries. 

Conversely, we do not think that wages in professional industries will be impacted significantly by the occurrence of a disaster. While these industries may lose some productivity related to having to close offices for a brief time, we feel that this will not be nearly enough to result in a significant drop in wages.

4. The relative intensity of a disaster in a given locality will be correlated to any negative impact on wages and unemployment.

We think that any localized economic impact resulting from a disaster will be proportional to the relative intensity of the disaster in that locality.

## Data

The data for wages is broken down into the following categories:

- natural resources and mining
- construction
- manufacturing
- service-providing
- trade, transportation, and utilities
- information
- financial activities
- professional and business services
- education and health services
- leisure and hospitality
- other services
- unclassified

We collected data for the following weather metrics:

- barometric pressure
- precipitation
- maximum sustained 2 minute wind speed
- maximum sustained 5 second wind speed
